// Package progressbar implements a basic asynchronous and thread-safe progress bar that can perform polling updates.
//
// Create a new progress bar by calling the New function and pass it a callback function that will be called every time the
// progress bar updates. This callback can update the progress bar's current count and other variables as needed.
//
// The progress bar can be customized with different options at creation.
